# Prek native configuration: preferred as the canonical configuration for pre-commit-style hooks.
# Pre-commit-style configuration for common checks and Python formatting.
# Mirrors the project's conventions: enable the recommended hooks from pre-commit-hooks and use Ruff
# for Python formatting and linting. Adjust or opt-out of any hooks as needed per team preference.
# This file replaces `.pre-commit-config.yaml`; that file has been removed to avoid duplication.
# Note: `prek` can read `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for compatibility, but `prek.toml` is preferred.

# Notes:
# - These hooks are a recommended baseline. If a particular hook is undesired (for example, forbidding
#   submodules in a repository that intentionally uses them), remove or configure that hook in `prek.toml`.
# - Keep hook repositories pinned (set `rev`) to an explicit release to ensure reproducible behaviour.

# Commit message linting using commitlint (Node.js). This uses
# the commitlint-pre-commit-hook bridge so it runs as a commit-msg hook.
# Note: Node.js must be available on developer machines to run this hook.
