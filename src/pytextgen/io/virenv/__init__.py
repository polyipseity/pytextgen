"""Virtual environment helpers for safely executing code fragments.

This package contains utilities for flashcards, code generation helpers,
and config used by the execution environment. Package public symbols are
intentionally defined in `pytextgen.io.virenv.meta` and `__init__.py` keeps
this package minimal (no public exports) to avoid accidental re-exports.
